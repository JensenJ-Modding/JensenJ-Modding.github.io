# You Shall Not Tick

You Shall Not Tick is a simple mod to reduce unneccessary processing of living entities in Minecraft.

You can refer to the sidebar for more information.

The mod also makes use of the Ponder library (used in the Create mod) to provide an in-game tutorial. Simply hover over an item from the mod to see how to use it.
Note: This may not be available in some versions of the mod due to Ponder not being available on that game version.

# 1.1.x - The Totem of Ticking

This was an attempt to clean up the mod and make it more user friendly. This version of the mod has been used in a production server environment for a year or so without any compatibility issues. Each patch in the 1.1.x lifecycle fixed a small bug or compat issue.

-   Added configuration files, and ability to make mobs exempt.
-   Made the mixin for entity disabling more compatible with other mods, and better handling of edge cases
-   Added the totem of ticking
-   A few other bug fixes caused by the mod

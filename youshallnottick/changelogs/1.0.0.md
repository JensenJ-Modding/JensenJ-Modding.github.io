# 1.0.0 - Initial Private Release

This is the first private released version of the mod. The mod was barely functional and was more of a test than anything, entities had broken animations and frequently glitched out due to just being skipped in the game update loop.

-   Mobs out of range of the player are skipped in the processing loop

# The Totem of Ticking

If Ponder is enabled in the version of the mod you are using, you can see this information in game.

The Totem of Ticking allows living entities within it's radius to tick like normal, regardless of the distance from players. It has a radius configured by the server.

It should be noted that the Totem of Ticking is not a chunk loader and will not allow monster spawners to function or act as a fake player.

Sneak clicking on the Totem of Ticking will enable an outline which shows the volume in which living entities will function as normal.

The Totem of Ticking can be controlled via redstone.

When powered with redstone, the totem is deactivated. It will no longer allow living entities within the radius to tick

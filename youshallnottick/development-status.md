# Development Status

This page shows the various mod versions and versions of Minecraft we support.

## Supported Game Versions

For each game version, I will aim to support:

-   The most recent release (e.g. 1.21.5).
-   The main modding version of the current major Minecraft version (e.g. 1.21.1).
-   The main modding version of the last major Minecraft version (e.g. 1.20.1).

#### Mod loaders

-   For game versions up to and including 1.20.1, I will support Fabric and Forge.
-   For game versions after 1.20.1, I will support Fabric and NeoForge.

If a version is marked as unsupported and a version exists already, it may receive patches for critical issues, but will have no new features.

Feel free to ask any questions about this on the Discord.

## Porting to other versions / modloaders

Unless there is significant demand for it, I will not support any other mod loader / version.
This is on a case by case basis however, so feel free to let me know if you want the mod ported.
